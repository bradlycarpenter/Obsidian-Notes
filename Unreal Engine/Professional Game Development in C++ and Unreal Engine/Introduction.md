### Unreal Project Browser

### Version Warning:

Attempting to launch a project that was made with a newer version of Unreal will result in the following error:![](Pictures/Opening%20with%20Older%20Version.png)
  
### Older Version:

Attempting to launch a project that was made with an older version of Unreal will present you with an option to open a copy of the project which will be converted to the new version.![](Pictures/Converting%20to%20Newer%20Version.png)
You can click on `More Options` to see the following menu:![](Pictures/Convert%20Project%20Options.png)
`Convert in-place` will convert the project without making a copy.
`Skip conversion` will simply open the project without converting or making a copy.

### New Project Tab:
A template can be chosen as a starting point.![](Pictures/New%20Project%20Window.png)
Templates are prebuilt projects that can be used to accelerate development.
**Blueprint vs C++:**
  ![](Pictures/Blueprint%20vs%20C++.png)
`Blueprint` is the built in visual scripting language.
`C++` is the traditional code based coding system.
They are interchangeable and you can change and add later so you need not worry which you are starting out with.

### Settings:
![](Pictures/Pasted%20image%2020240731005434.png)
`Target` allows you to select your targeted platform.
`Quality Preset` is changeable so you need not worry what you select.
`Starter Content` is a collection of resources; audio files, blueprints for scripting purposes, some textures like grass or bricks, some meshes like walls and doors to quickly accelerate development of your project.

### Project Directory Selection:
