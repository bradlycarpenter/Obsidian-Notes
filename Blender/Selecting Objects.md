Edited Objects are hilighted in the **Outliner**:

The `Outliner` Provides a hierarchical view of the scene. Objects can also be selected in this menu. 

# The Properties Editor:

# Selecting Multiple Objects:

By holding the `shift` key you can select more objects at once. As well as adding to the selection, the `shift` key also toggles selection. You can remove an object by holding `shift` and clicking on the selected object again.

The different shades of orange when multiple objects are selected indicate which object is the **active** object.

The active object will be the one who's properties are visible in the property editor.

Normal explorer selection hotkeys can be used in the outliner such as `shift` to select a range, `ctrl` to select individual elements and clicking in an empty space to deselect selected elements.

All Objects can be Selected by going to `Select` > `All` or by using the `A` hotkey. You can deselect everything by using the hotkey `Alt + A`.

Notice the Properties Editor still displays the properties of the Cube object even though no object is selected. This is because the Cube is still the Active object indicated by the highlighted icon in the Outline and the small orange dot on the cube itself.

# Selecting Objects using the Active Tool:
