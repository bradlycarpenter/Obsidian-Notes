## Note on Adding Objects:

When adding objects, notice that they get added to the center of the world.

New objects in blender get added to wherever the `3D` Cursor is.

## One can also use the `Shift + A` hotkey:

# Moving the 3D Cursor:
By selecting the same icon in the toolbar you will be able to left click in empty space to place the `3D Cursor` in other places.

The `3D Cursor` can also be moved with any tool selected by using `Shift + Right Click` anywhere in the scene.

You can also return the cursor to it's default position by selecting `Object` in the viewport, then `Snap` and select `Cursor to World Origin`.

You can also snap the `3D Cursor` to a selected object by selecting `Object` in the viewport again, then `Snap` and select `Cursor to Selected`.

The `Snap` menu can also be brought up quickly by using the `Shift + S` hotkey. 

One can also move an object to the `3D Cursor` by selecting `Selection to Cursor`.

# Adjusting the Last Added Object
When adding an object to the scene one can adjust it's values by opening up the `Adjust Last Operation` Box found in the lower left hand side.

Note: Once you click off of a cube, select another object, `Adjust Last Operation` box will disappear. If you have only done one action since the boxes disappearance then simply press `F9`. 

# Adding Shapes from the Toolbar:
One can draw shapes using the `Add Cube` tool. First select the tool, then draw the area for the base of the shape and then drag away from the base to adjust the length of the shape.
