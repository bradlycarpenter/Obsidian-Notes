# Properties Editor Transform Controls:

Move Along X Axis:
![[Rotate Along X Axis.png]]

Values can also be adjusted by:

- Clicking and dragging left and right on the value.
- You can enter math inside the value as well for example `2 + 5` would adjust the value to 7.
- Alternative units can also be entered if the correct notation is used for example `5cm` would move the unit 5cm to the x axis in this instance. It will also do conversion if a different system is used for example feet to meters.

![[Changing Units.png]]
The Unit System can be adjusted by navigating to `scene` > `Units` in the Property Editor.

![[Left Click Drag to Adjust Values.png]]

Gizmos can be toggled on so that they are visible and adjustable regardless of the selected tool.

![[Reset Transform.png]]

All Location, Rotation and Scale values can be reset by navigating to `Object` > `Rotation` > `Scale`. Hotkeys can also be used: `Alt G` for Location, `Alt R` for Rotation and `Alt S` for scale.

![[Object Mouse Transform Shortcut.png]]

Shortcuts can be used to transform selected objects with the mouse. This will temporarily engage the the corresponding transform until left mouse is clicked. Hotkeys can also be used here. Namely, `G` for Move, `R` for Rotate and `S` for Scale.

# Key Stroke Combinations:

A combination of keystrokes can be used to make adjustments to the transform without adjusting the Property Editor.

It can be done in the following 3 stages:

1. First, Press the hotkey of the corresponding transformation:

`G` For Move
`R` For Rotate
`S` For Scale

2. Constrain transformation to a corresponding Axis:

`X` for X Axis
`z` for Z Axis
`Y` for Y Axis

Note: If no Axis is selected then you will be making an adjustment to all Axis.

3. Use number keys to make adjustments in numbered increments.

Entering a number after the first two stages have been completed will transform the object by the entered number along the selected plane by the unit value selected. Confirm by pressing enter.

# Last Adjusted Panel:
