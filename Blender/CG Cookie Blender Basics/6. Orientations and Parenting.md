Whenever we transform something in 3D space it always happens in a particular order. 

1. The Location.
2. The Rotation.
3. The Scale.

There is a reason why it's always listed this way in the properties window. Let's say we rotate our cube 90 degrees along the X axis:![[90 Degrees Rotation.png]]

Now let's adjust it's scale along the X axis: ![[Scale Cube in X Axis.png]]

Still working as intended, now let's scale the object in the Y axis:![[Scale Cube in Y Axis.png]]

Here we can see that that while we are correctly transforming the cube in the Y axis according to it's orientation we need to be aware that this conflicts with the orientation of our world.

# Transformation Orientation

We can view and work with this much more intuitively if we switch over to our move tool and change our `Transformation Orientation` from global to local.

Global Orientation: ![[Global Orientation.png]]\

Local Orientation:![[Local Orientation.png]]
Think of Global Orientation as the true North, South, East and West of 3D space where as the Local Orientation is like a Right, Left, Up or Down relative to each object. It may be easier to perform transformation tasks on objects when working in Local Orientation. 

For example, let's add a cylinder instead of a Cube.

1. First delete the cube using the `delete` key. 
2. Add a cylinder by using the `Shift + A` shortcut menu.
3. Move it in the Z axis so that it sits above the floor.
4. Rotate it along the X axis by using the shortcut `R > X`.

![[Rotated Cylinder.png]]

Let's adjust the scale along it's local axis by changing to the `Scale Tool` and then dragging along it's local z axis by pressing `S > Z`: ![[Cylinder Scaled Along Local Z.png]]

That worked perfectly, however notice what happens when we switch our `Transformation Orientation` to global and attempt to adjust the scale in the same way:![[Cylinder Distorted.png]]

Note: When transforming using hotkeys the software will always default to transforming along the orientation we have set in the viewport. You can however move objects along global orientation while in local orientation mode by pressing the hotkey for the axis you would like to transform your object across twice. The opposite is true while in global orientation mode.

If you find yourself adjusting your `Transformation Orientation` settings often you can also adjust this setting by using the hotkey `,` on the keyboard and you will be presented with the following menu:
![[Transformation Orientation Hotkey.png]]

# Clearing Transformations

In a previous lesson we looked at how we can clear transformations by navigating to `Object` > `Clear` > `Location` which will reset the object back to it's original position. Instead of only clearing, we can also apply transformations such that the object remains visually the same but the object's transformations go back to their default.

For example if we move our cylinder off from it's default position and then select `Object` > `Apply` > `Location` it will stay in the same spot but you will notice that the origin, where it's transformed from, has been brought back to the world center.

![[Origin to World Center.png]]
For now let's undo that change and look at a situation where this may be more useful.

Let's consider the event where the object is rotated 90 degrees along the X axis:
![[90 on X.png]]

Let's imagine that this is a log or something that will always be rotated in this way in the scene. Instead of standing on it's end, it doesn't really make sense for Z to be pointing outwards towards the side:
![[Z Pointing Sideways.png]]

If all of your objects have different orientations it can become very confusing to work with. 

To align this object back to the world you can select `Object` > `Apply` > `Rotation`:
![[Rotation Applied to Object.png]]

Now you can see that the Z axis is pointed in the correct direction. 

Now if we wanted to scale it along it's length we can do that along the Y axis:
![[Scale Along Y.png]]

You can also navigate to the `Apply` by pressing `Ctrl + A`.

# Using Another Object as the Origin

Let's add another cube and move it off to the side:
![[Cube Added.png]]

If you wanted to use the cube as the point of reference for the cylinder instead, then you can simply select the cylinder, go to the `Object Properties` window, expand the `Relations` tab, and set the cube as the parent.
![[Parenting Objects.png]]

Now we can see that the cylinder has moved straight into the position of the cube.

Let's say we wanted to move the cylinder on top of the cube:
![[Cylinder on Top of Cube.png]]

Nothing seems out of the ordinary, except when attempting to move the cube you will notice some interesting behaviour:
![[Object Moves with Parent.png]]
Now the cylinder always follows the movement of the cube. The same will be true when you attempt to rotate or scale the cube, the cylinder is going to inherit all of these transformations.

However it is important to remember that no changes made to the cylinder will have an effect on the cube:
![[Parent Unaffected by Changes Made to the Child.png]]

If you want to remove the relationship between these objects then you can simply press the `x` icon in the `Relations` tab under `Parent`. You will notice that the values listed in under the `Transform` tab do not change when changing the parent of the cylinder. This is because those values represent the objects transformation relative to something else. 

A more intuitive way to adjust the inheritance of an object may be to change it in the 3D viewport instead. 

Let's unparent our cube and undo our transformations by pressing `Alt + R` and `Alt + S` and then we'll place it on top of our cube again. Now we will first select the cylinder, then the cube by holding `Shift`, then selecting `Object` > `Parent` > `Object`. Now again the cylinder is parented to the cube but it hasn't jumped around as it might if you parented the cylinder after having already made adjustments to it's position. You can also select `Clear and Keep Transformation` if you would like to unparent the cylinder while maintaining it's current position. You can also bring up this menu by pressing the shortcut `Ctrl+P`.

Note that in the `Outliner` the cylinder will become nested inside the cube when it becomes it's child:
![[Child Objects Nested Inside Parent Objects.png]]

You can also make changes to the inheritance of objects inside the `Outliner` by holding `shift` and dragging the objects outside of nests to unparent them or on top of other objects to make those objects the parent object.
