Whenever we transform something in 3D space it always happens in a particular order. 

1. The Location.
2. The Rotation.
3. The Scale.

There is a reason why it's always listed this way in the properties window. Let's say we rotate our cube 90 degrees along the X axis:![[90 Degrees Rotation.png]]

Now let's adjust it's scale along the X axis: ![[Scale Cube in X Axis.png]]

Still working as intended, now let's scale the object in the Y axis:![[Scale Cube in Y Axis.png]]

Here we can see that that while we are correctly transforming the cube in the Y axis according to it's orientation we need to be aware that this conflicts with the orientation of our world.

# Transformation Orientation

We can view and work with this much more intuitively if we switch over to our move tool and change our `Transformation Orientation` from global to local.

Global Orientation: ![[Global Orientation.png]]\

Local Orientation:![[Local Orientation.png]]
Think of Global Orientation as the true North, South, East and West of 3D space where as the Local Orientation is like a Right, Left, Up or Down relative to each object. It may be easier to perform transformation tasks on objects when working in Local Orientation. 

For example, let's add a cylinder instead of a Cube.

1. First delete the cube using the `delete` key. 
2. Add a cylinder by using the `Shift + A` shortcut menu.
3. Move it in the Z axis so that it sits above the floor.
4. Rotate it along the X axis by using the shortcut `R > X`.

Let's adjust the scale along it's local axis by changing to the `Scale Tool` and then dragging along it's local z axis by pressing `S > Z`: ![[Cylinder Scaled Along Local Z.png]]

That worked perfectly, however notice what happens when we switch our `Transformation Orientation` to global and attempt to adjust the scale in the same way:![[Cylinder Distorted.png]]

Note: When transforming using hotkeys the software will always default to transforming along the orientation we have set in the viewport. You can however move objects along global orientation while in local orientation mode by pressing the hotkey for the axis you would like to transform your object across twice. The opposite is true while in global orientation mode.

If you find yourself adjusting your `Transformation Orientation` settings often you can also adjust this setting by using the hotkey `,` on the keyboard and you will be presented with the following menu:
