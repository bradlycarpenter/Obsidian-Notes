# Introduction

The **factorial** of a whole number ('n') is defined as the product of that number ('n') with every whole number less than or equal to 'n' till 1.

Now let's simplify the factorial by multiplying the products of it's parts.

# Example: 6 Factorial

Again, 1 falls away, 30 multiplied by two is 60 and 60 multiplied by 12 is 720.
