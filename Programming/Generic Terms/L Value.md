In programming, particularly in C and C++, an L-value (short for Left value) refers to an object or expression that represents a memory location that can persist beyond a single expression. In simpler terms, it's something that has an address in memory and can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment operation (hence the name).

For example:

- int x = 5;	
	- x is an L-value because it refers to a memory location that stores the value 5, and you can assign new values to x.

An R-value (short for Right value) refers to a temporary value or a literal that doesn't necessarily have a persistent memory address and often appears on the right-hand side of an assignment.

For example:

- In x = 5;, the number 5 is an R-value, because it's a temporary value that doesn't persist in memory outside this expression.

When your instructor says "the operand must have an L-value, so it can't be a constant or an expression that evaluates to temporary values," they mean that the operand of the address-of operator (&) must refer to a memory location (like a variable), not a constant or temporary value. You can't take the address of an R-value like a literal (e.g., &5 is invalid).
