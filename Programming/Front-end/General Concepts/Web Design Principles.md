Angela Yu argues that the four pillars of good Web Design are:

- Color Theory
- Typography
- User Interface Design
- User Experience Design

In this document we'll look at these principles in more detail.
# Color Theory

It's important to be cognizant of how we use color throughout our webpage. Colors can give of different moods, feelings and meanings and using colors that fit well together make our web pages more appealing.
## Mood

Different colors give different moods, feelings and meanings, let's look at a few examples:
### Red

Red gives off a sense of love, energy and intensity. This is why it's often used in automotive adverts as well as the primary color of Tinder.

### Yellow

Yellow can be associated with joy and intellect but it's also a color that grabs attention.

### Green

Green represents freshness, safety and growth. This is why many food, medical and lifestyle brands will use this as the primary color for their brand.

### Blue

Blue is all about stability, trust and serenity. This color is commonly associated with brands in the financial sector where it's important that consumers feel that they can trust these brands with their money.

### Purple

Royalty, wealth and femininity are commonly associated with the color purple. You will often see this color associated with brands that attempt to make the consumer feel that using their service will make them wealthier such as credit providers and gambling services.

### Cheatsheet

Here's a cheat sheet for some of the most common primary colors:

## Color Relationships

Making appealing use of multiple colors together turns out to be a fairly scientific practice. When viewing colors on a color wheel we can pick color combinations by their mathematical relationships to create a color pallete.
### Complementary Colors

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Complementary.png)

Two colors that are on the opposite sides of the color wheel are known as *complimentary colors*. This combination provides a high contrast and allows the colors to appear brighter and more prominent.
### Monochromatic

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Monochromatic.png)

Using similar shades, tones and tints of one base color provides a subtle and conservative color combination. This is a versatile color combination that is easy to apply to design projects for a harmonious look.
### Triadic

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Triadic.png)

Three colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel provide a high contrast color scheme but less so than the complimentary color scheme making it more versatile.

## Color with Font

It's important to be cognizant of how you are applying color theory to UI elements and readable text. While some color combinations may look appealing on logos or artworks they can be difficult to read or decipher when used in a font foreground or background.

# Typography
Just as colors are associated with different moods and emotions, so are fonts.

The two most widely used font families are **Serif** and **Sans-Serif** fonts.
## Serif Fonts

Serif fonts are defined by having *Serifs*. These are the added strokes or lines at the end of letters.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Serif%20vs%20Sans%20Serif.png)

Serif fonts however come in multiple varieties of shapes, sizes and styles with some historical context.

In the case of Sans Serif fonts the difference between the thinnest and thickest part of the font generally describes how old or modern the font is.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Different%20Kinds%20of%20Sans%20Serifs.png)

Old style serifs make good fits for brands interested in emulating vintage styles such as whiskies or vintage fashion brands. Transitional fonts, generally used for financial business or law firms, give a sense of establishment and security. Finally Didone or Modern Sans Serif fonts are used in trendy but authorative contexts such as high end fashion brands, magazines, etc.
## Sans-Serif Fonts

Sans-Serif fonts don't feature any serifs, they have squared off edges (sometimes rounded) with no added line or stroke. These fonts are generally more legible, readable and friendly. 

The earliest form of the Sans Serif is the *Grotesque* Sans Serif. Receiving it's name from the Italian word *grottesco*, meaning "belonging to the cave", this font was considered bold, shocking and ugly at the time for not featuring any serifs.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Grotesque%20Serif.png)

*Neo-Grotesque* sans serif is a tweaked and evolved version of the grotesque sans serif, first appearing i the mid-twentieth century.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Neo%20Grotesque%20Serif.png)

*Humanist* sans serif takes inspiration from traditional letterforms. Because of this, you can often find calligraphic elements, such as stroke variation, and more organic structural elements, like a double-story lowercase "a" or "g" in Humanist sans serifs.

## How To Use Typography

Besides picking the correct font for the mood and context of the webpage it is important to limit your use of different font styles only to two at the most, using a Serif for headings and a Sans-Serif for the body text. This is the most common approach however it is not a rule. You can also use different font weights to provide clean separation of different element importance on your web page.
# User Interface Design

Effective UI design involves creating websites that are easy to understand, presentable, and effective at communicating information to the reader. We can do this by employing the following design principles to guide the user's eye to important information as well as dictating the order in which the user will look at one object to the next.
## Hierarchy

Using examples from [here](https://uxplanet.org/principles-of-visual-hierarchy-in-ui-design-fbcd31f88088) have a look at this image:

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Hierarchy.png)

We can guide the user's eye to view elements in our web page in a specific order by creating a hierarchy of importance through the use of varying **size** and **color**. 

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Size.png)

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Color.png)

A user will naturally place more important on larger objects first as well as colorful objects. Notice how the orange discount advertisement jumps out of the middle image in the second example.
## Layout

A webpage that conforms to a singular layout with no variation in paragraph length, size of titles or use of media will look bland and uninteresting. Take a look at the Wikipedia webpage for example.

Another pitfall of the Wikipedia web page is the width of text.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Width.png)

Notice how wide each paragraph stretches, this makes it more difficult for the user to keep track of which line they're on when reading.

Wikipedia has updated their website to make it possible to adjust the width of text to conform to a more modern narrow design.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Modern%20Width.png)

Condensing the text makes the web page more readable and cohesive.
## Alignment

Ensure elements on your web page are cohesively aligned so that they all seem to "start" from the same anchor but also ensure to reduce the amount  of alignment points necessary for your web page.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Alignment.png)

Notice how, while the sizes of elements may differ, all elements are equally anchored to the left hand size. More importantly notice the width of the design button and thumbnail of the articles being the same.
## White Space

White space or negative space if used effectively can increase the perceived value of what is being looked at. Imagine the difference between a luxury handbag store and a discount store, generally the luxury store will have bags spaced far apart with a lot of negative space around them where as discount stores are often crammed to the brim with products.

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Negative%20Space.png)

## Audience

Finally and most importantly it's important to consider the user that you are targeting and make that your overall style fits the context it's found in. While comic sans may not be usable to represent a banking company it may be useful for children's advertising.

# User Experience

Where UI and UX differ is in the usability of your website or the *experience* that the user has using your web page.

Humans have studied and proven habits which create an expectation of how things will work when using web pages which cause frustration when things don't function as expected.
## Simplicity

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Simplicity.png)

The google landing page is a classic example of good, simple UX design. No more information is provided than necessary and should you wish to access more services you can do so by clicking the grid box icon in the corner.
## Consistency

We are adept at recognizing patterns and a lack of consistency creates a poor user experience.

Take a look at Xfinity's mobile, streaming and internet pages:

**Xfinity ISP**

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Xfinity%20Overview.png)

**Xfinity Stream**

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Xfinity%20Stream.png)

**Xfinity Mobile**

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Xfinity%20Mobile.png)

Three different web pages all from the same company which feature not only different visual designs but also different layouts and placements of important elements of interactivity.
## Reading Patterns

People generally read web pages using one of two reading patterns:

**F Shaped Pattern**

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20F%20Shaped%20Pattern.png)

**Z Shaped Pattern**

![](Pictures/Web%20Design%20Principles%20-%20Z%20Shaped%20Pattern.png)

Always be cognizant of how the user scans your web pages and be sure to place elements that they are most likely going to want to interact with in the order of these scanning patterns.
## Platform Design

Web pages are viewed on multiple platforms and so it is important to approach UX design with an *All Platform Design*. Generally speaking "mobile" and "desktop" versions of websites have been largely phased out and the approach instead is to make a web page that will dynamically adjust it's layout to match the platform that it is being viewed on. Some may say to take a *mobile first* approach however this can also result in a poor desktop experience where columns are too narrow and text is too large wasting space that could be used more effeciently.
## Avoiding "Dark" Design Patterns

Dark design patterns are patterns that exploit natural human tendencies by tricking users into clicking on options they don't intend to or making the functionality of elements ambiguous so that users accidentally select options that will cost them more and benefit the company. Over time this will steer users away from your platform as they have repeated poor experiences.
