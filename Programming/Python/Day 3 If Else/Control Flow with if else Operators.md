# Introduction

`if` And `else` statements in python don't enclose their conditions within parenthesis and don't enclose their code blocks inside squiggly braces. 

Instead a colon is used after the condition and the code block itself is indented to indicate where it needs to execute.

```python nums
if height > 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster")
else:
    print("Sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
```

**Note:** Incorrect indentation will cause an *indentation error* so be sure that the else: keyword is placed at the same level of indentation as the `if` keyword.
# Conditional Statements:

- The `and` keyword can be used in place of the `&&` operator.
- The `or` keyword can be used in place of the `||` operator.
- The `not` keyword reverses the condition that it is used for.
