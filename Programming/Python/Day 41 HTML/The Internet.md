### Headings:

Headings in HTML function the same as they would in a book, or as in this markdown file, for example:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

They are used to display how many levels you are deep into a document, the equivalent in HTML would look like this:

```html
<h>Heading 1</h>
<h>Heading 2</h>
<h>Heading 3</h>
<h>Heading 4</h>
<h>Heading 5</h>
<h>Heading 6</h>
```

**Note:** 
- Heading 6 is the final heading, there is no heading 7. 
- Closing tags must also match opening tags.
- Don't use multiple Heading 1 tags in the same document, there should only be one as it serves as the main heading for the web page.
- Don't skip heading levels ie, move from heading 1 to heading 3.
