4 Space Indentation is used in Python to serve the purpose of what a "code block" would in other languages.

For code to execute inside of an if statement or inside of a function the logic should be indented by 4 spaces ahead of it's parent line:

```python
def sayHello()
print("Hello")
#^ incorrect indentation

def sayHello()
	print("Hello")
#   ^ correct indentation 
```
