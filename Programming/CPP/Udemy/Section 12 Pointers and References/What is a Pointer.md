# Introduction:

- A Variable
	- Who's Value is an Address

- What Can be at That Address?
	- Another Variable
	- A Function

- Pointers Point to Variables or Functions

- If x is an Integer Variable and it's Value is 10 Then We Can Declare a Pointer That Points to it.

- To use the Data That the Pointer is Pointing to We Must Know it's Type.

# Why use Pointers?
Can't we just use the variable or function itself?

**Yes, but not always.**

- Inside Functions, Pointers can be Used to Access Data That are Defined Outside the Function. Those Variables May Not be in Scope so You Can't Access Them by Their Name.

- Pointers Can be Used to Operate on Arrays Very Efficiently.

- We Can Allocate Memory Dynamically on the Heap or Free Store.
	- This Memory Doesn't Even Have a Variable Name.
	- The Only Way to Get to it is Via a Pointer.

- With OO. Pointers are How Polymorphism Works!

- Can Access Specific Addresses in Memory.
	- Useful in Embedded and Systems Applications.
