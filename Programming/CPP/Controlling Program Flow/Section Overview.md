# Controlling Program Flow:

- Sequence
	 Ordering Statements Sequentially

- Selection
	 Making Decisions

- Iteration
	 Looping or Repeating

With sequence, selection and iteration we can implement any algorithm.

## Selection - Decision Making:

- `if` statement
- `else-if` statement
- Nested `if` statements
- `switch` statement
- Conditional operator `?:`
## Iteration - Looping:

- `for` loop
- Range-based `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop
- `continue` and `break`
- infinite `loops`
- Nested `loops`
