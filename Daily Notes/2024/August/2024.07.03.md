I think today marks a massive tipping point in my life where I'm really beginning to grasp my own level of intelligence. I've known for a long time that I think and act differently than from those around me but I've never really thought much of it. Working in a team and seeing how other people solve problems has made me realize how vastly more efficient and elegantly I tend to understand things and find not only solutions but the best solutions in these situations. How I'll obsess over things, improving, iterating, refactoring till it's perfection.

Speaking of perfection, many people say not to strive for perfection. Something that's good enough and finished is better than something perfect that doesn't exist. I've been trying to change the way I think to think this way for the last decade but it's never felt true to how I feel or think about things. I think people are generally incapable of perfection and for most people aiming for good enough would help them accomplish more but for me there is no option besides perfect. 

I think a fear of failure or rather a lack in confidence in myself has led me to believe I shouldn't strive for perfection but that is completely incorrect. I'm capable of perfection and far beyond it, far beyond what people can imagine.

With this realization I've also realized that I'm too smart to waste my time and that order in my life will only empower me (as I write this at 4am, lol). I'm going to track how I feel, add interesting tid bits from my day and try to optimize my day to day life.

Here's a piece of code I refactored and optimized, below is what was written:
```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

var screen_size : Vector2
var speed = 400

func _ready():
	screen_size = get_viewport_rect().size
	position = screen_size / 2

func _physics_process(delta):
	#limit movement to window size
	position = position.clamp(Vector2.ZERO, screen_size)
	
	# Determine the direction of the animation based on the input using if-elif
	if Input.is_action_pressed("right"):
		$AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h = false
		$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "walk_right"
		$AnimatedSprite2D.play()
		position.x += speed * delta
		if Input.is_action_pressed("up"):
			position.y -= speed * delta * 0.5
		elif Input.is_action_pressed("down"):
			position.y += speed * delta * 0.5
			
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("left"):
		$AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h = true
		$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "walk_left"
		$AnimatedSprite2D.play()
		position.x -= speed * delta
		if Input.is_action_pressed("up"):
			position.y -= speed * delta * 0.5
		elif Input.is_action_pressed("down"):
			position.y += speed * delta * 0.5
			
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("down"):
		$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "walk_down"
		$AnimatedSprite2D.play()
		position.y += speed * delta
		
	elif Input.is_action_pressed("up"):
		$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "walk_up"
		$AnimatedSprite2D.play()
		position.y -= speed * delta
	else:
		$AnimatedSprite2D.stop()
		$AnimatedSprite2D.frame = 0

```

Here is my solution:
```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

var screen_size : Vector2
var speed = 400
var direction : Vector2

func _ready():
	screen_size = get_viewport_rect().size
	position = screen_size / 2

func _movement(delta):
	direction = Input.get_vector("left", "right", "up", "down")
	velocity = direction * speed * delta
	position += velocity 

func _spriteDirection():
	if (!$AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h and direction.x < 0):
		$AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h = true
	elif ($AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h and direction.x > 0):
		$AnimatedSprite2D.flip_h = false

func _spriteSelect():
	if direction:
		$AnimatedSprite2D.play()
		if direction.y < 0:
			$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "walk_up"
		elif direction.y > 0:
			$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "walk_down"
		elif direction.x != 0:
			$AnimatedSprite2D.animation = "walk_right"
	else:
		$AnimatedSprite2D.stop()

func _physics_process(delta):
	#limit movement to window size
	position = position.clamp(Vector2.ZERO, screen_size)
	_movement(delta)
	_spriteDirection()
	_spriteSelect()

```

As for my mental health, today is Heather's Birthday and for some reason after nearly a decade my experience with her continue's to haunt me everyday. I feel confused, resentment, regret and I still can't make sense of my decision making back then. Ultimately I'll need to move on from it to achieve my goals but man it hurts. I have nightmares, trouble sleeping, trouble getting out of bed to the point where I feel afraid to go to sleep and need to watch a live stream before bed to calm my mind. It makes it difficult to get into routine when one bad dream completely knocks me out it.

Routine does help with this at the end of the day. If I'm able to sleep faster, wake up more regularly then I can reduce the time I spend mulling over something she's likely completely forgotten about and moved on from. It hurts to accept that fact, but it's a fact that needs to be accepted to move on.

As for what's next:

- Improve my sleeping routine.
- Spend less time wasting my time on people who don't deserve it, I don't have to prove anything to anyone. Results will come with time and dedication.
- Que some damn emails, I need to find good work.
- Keep the Uncle happy, It's not about him. It's not about pride, it's about what's right for my future.
